### Overview

This project is an exploration of **procedural content generation as a design tool.**

The generator emphasizes:

- Visual feedback for ease of learning
- Rapid iteration for designers and developers
- Modular generator components

It is intended as both:

- A reusable foundation for future games
- A teaching and experimentation platform for procedural techniques

---

### Key Features

- Drunken walk map generation
- Perlin noise–based terrain
- Cellular automata–driven maps
- Room-and-corridor “roguelike” generation

---

### Tech Stack

- **Engine:** Godot 4.5
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Artwork:** Aseprite pixel art

---

### Use Cases

- Procedural dungeon or overworld generation
- Teaching procedural generation concepts
- Rapid prototyping of level layouts
- Visual debugging of generation algorithms
- Solid foundation for future multiplayer-safe, data-driven generation systems

---

### Roadmap

- Additional generation algorithms
- Improved visualization modes
- Save/load generation states
- Integration with gameplay systems
