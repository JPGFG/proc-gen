### Overview

This project is an exploration of **procedural content generation as a design tool.**

The generator emphasizes:

- Visual Feedback for ease of learning
- Deterministic generation via seeds and parameters
- Rapid iteration for designers and developers
- Modular generator components

It is indended as both:

- A reusable foundation for future games
- A teaching and experimentation platform for procedural techniques

### Key Features

- Drunken Walk
- Perlin Noise
- Cellular Automata
- Room and Corridor 'Roguelike' Generation

### Tech Stack

**Version:** GODOT 4.5 (GDscript)

**Language:** GDScript

**Artwork:** Aseprite Pixel Art

### Use Cases

- Procedural dungeon or overworld generation
- Teaching procedural generation concepts
- Rapid prototyping of level layouts
- Visual debugging of generation algorithms
- Foundation for multiplayer-safe deterministic generation

### Roadmap

- Additional generation algorithms
- Improved visualization modes
- Save/load generation states
- Integration with gameplay systems
